      <h1>How I Got Started</h1>
      <p>I suppose it's in my genes. All of my family is artistic, so I was encouraged from a very young age to be creative.</p>

    <h1>Grade School Years</h1>
    <p>As a little kid, I used to make "stationery" and write nice things on it and give it to my friends and family.</p>
  </div>

<article class="slide">
  <div class="intro">
    <h1>You're so Thoughtful!</h1>
    <p>Of course, everyone thought it was adorable that I would draw cute pictures and write sweet things to the people I loved, and so it encouraged me to continue.</p>

    <h1>Christmas Success!</h1>
    <p>One year, my mom got me really cool rubber stamps, embossing powder, and heavyweight blank cards and asked me to make her Christmas cards for the season. Of course I jumped at the idea! I made about 100 cards, and they were a huge hit with all of the recipients.</p>

    <h1>High School Creativity</h1>
    <p>When I got to high school, I kept making cards. They got more sophisticated as my artistic nature grew. As I collected more craft supplies over the years, my cards kept getting more sophisticated and intricate. People kept telling me, "You should sell these!" And that's where it all started.</p>

  <h1>Studie Stationery</h1>
  <p>Fast forward 10 years, and I was still casually making holiday cards and sending them to my friends and family. I love holidays and try to celebrate them every season. I began to send out homemade cards for all of the major holidays: Christmas, Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Easter, Halloween, and Thanksgiving. My friends all loved the thoughtful notes I would send them, so I decided to start hosting craft parties so that my friends could do the same for their loved ones. We had a great time! Socializing, laughing, and sharing creativity can be so much fun!</p>

  <h1>Studie Stationery Today</h1>
  <p>One day in 2016, I decided to sell my handmade holiday cards online. Thus started my little shop on Etsy. I put up dozens of types of cards - for all major holidays and also cards to say "thank you," "congratulations," "happy birthday," etc.</p>
    <p>I still host craft parties and charge only the cost of the materials used.</p>
